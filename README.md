## Problem Statement

The project aims to conduct comprehensive **data analysis** on a weather dataset comprising variables such as **temperature (Temp_C)**, **dew point temperature (Dew Point Temp_C)**, **relative humidity (Rel Hum_%)**, **wind speed (Wind Speed_km/h)**, **visibility (Visibility_km)**, **pressure (Press_kPa)**, and **weather conditions (Weather_condition)**. Through this analysis, the objective is to uncover insights and patterns in the data.
The project utilizes **matplotlib**, **seaborn**, and **plotly** for data visualization to provide a comprehensive understanding of the weather dataset.
