## Problem Statement

The project aims to conduct comprehensive **data analysis** on a weather dataset comprising variables such as **temperature (Temp_C)**, **dew point temperature (Dew Point Temp_C)**, **relative humidity (Rel Hum_%)**, **wind speed (Wind Speed_km/h)**, **visibility (Visibility_km)**, **pressure (Press_kPa)**, and **weather conditions (Weather_condition)**. Through this analysis, the objective is to uncover insights and patterns in the data.
The project utilizes **matplotlib**, **seaborn**, and **plotly** for data visualization to provide a comprehensive understanding of the weather dataset.

## Aim of the analysis

1. **Understanding Weather Patterns:** The analysis aims to unravel trends and patterns within the weather dataset, providing insights into temperature fluctuations, humidity levels, wind speed variations, and other meteorological phenomena.

2. **Identifying Correlations:** By examining the relationships between different weather parameters, the analysis seeks to identify correlations and dependencies, shedding light on how these variables interact and influence each other.

3. **Informing Decision Making:** Through data-driven insights, the analysis aims to assist in informed decision-making processes, such as urban planning, agricultural management, and emergency preparedness, by providing a deeper understanding of prevailing weather conditions and their potential impacts.
